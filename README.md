# Werewolf Dark Mode

## Project Overview

This is a project I came up with to use a light-mode dark-mode switcher to morph from a normal scene to a werewolf theme. It sounded like a cool idea, and I hadn't seen a website like it (I am sure there are some, but I haven't seen them). This should be a good project to practice some animations and come up with some nice designs.
